# Iteration One

???

* Pair Up, Decide Who Goes First
* Speaker: Talk For The Full Five Minutes
* Listener: Keep Time, Listen, Give Feedback

---

# GOOD FEEDBACK IS:

## Sensitive
## Relevant
## Actionable

# Focus: Hooks

???

* SENSITIVE: Not everyone is at the same comfort level with speaking;
* RELEVANT: Stay focused on the talk, not what it reminds you of;
* ACTIONABLE: Give them concrete feedback that will improve their talk;
* HOOKS: What about their story is pulling you in?

---

# While You're Waiting

## Start thinking about how to break your 4-5 points into 20 slides.

## Try writing out one bullet point for each slide.

---

???

* "We know you're feeling this way, Let's Show You Why"
* Bright Colors = Memes &amp; Cheap Laughs

---

# What You Should Be Doing Now

## Break your 4-5 points down into 20 slides.

## Replace the content on every slide 1-2 words reminding you what you want to talk about.

## Begin finding pictures for your slides.

## Too much information will pull focus from the story.

---

# GOOD FEEDBACK IS:

## Sensitive
## Relevant
## Actionable

# Focus: Storytelling

???

* Does the story have a beginning, middle and end?
* Does the narritive flow?
* Are there parts that don't fit?

---

# While You're Waiting

## Integrate Feedback From Your Iteration

## Continue To Decorate Slides

???

* Don't try all that at once;
* Do what's comfortable;
* Avoid hands in pockets or hand wringing;
* Video yourself;
* Don't Present To Me
* Eye Contact;
* Too Much To Say?
** Split across two slides;
** Use unique images;
* Too Little To Say?
** Pregnant pause
** Rhetorical question
** Cut It

---

# What You Should Be Doing Now

## Incorporate Feedback.

## Continue decorating your slides.

## Remember: If you need to stretch a point across two slides, using two different images will help you stay in the flow.

---

# GOOD FEEDBACK IS:

## Sensitive
## Relevant
## Actionable

# Focus: Transitions

???

* When are the transitions working well?


---

# While You Are Waiting
